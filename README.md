# Themal-Detonator

Thermal Detonator from Star Wars ROTJ

Arduino code to make the lights blink either in a sequence or randomly. Uses a DFPlayer mini for the sound effects and placed it all in a 3d printed thermal detonator from thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:809004

The code is non blocking and works OK for the most part.  Uses library https://github.com/PowerBroker2/DFPlayerMini_Fast

Thanks for looking.
