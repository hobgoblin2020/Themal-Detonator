# Themal-Detonator
Themal Detonator from Star Wars ROTJ

Arduino code to make the lights blink either in a sqeucne or randmonly.  Uses a DFPlayer mini for the sound effects and placed it all in a 3d printed thermal detontor from thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:809004

The code is non blocking and works OK for the most part.  

Thanks for looking.
